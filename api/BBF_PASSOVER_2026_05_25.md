# BBF · Engineering Passover · 2026-05-25

You're picking up the Build Believe Fit codebase mid-flight. **Read this file end-to-end before touching code.** Then read `api/BBF_MASTER_PLAN.md`. Then ask Akeem what to attack.

## Mission in one paragraph

Build Believe Fit (BBF) is a fitness-coaching PWA + multi-agent AI backend run by Akeem Brown (founder, sole operator). The app lives at https://buildbelievefit.fitness as a static PWA, backed by Supabase Postgres + 25+ Supabase edge functions + a Node.js Express service on Render called `vision-scout` that hosts a Playwright smoke-test surface AND the new outbound marketing engine. Two parallel email systems exist: System 1 (Brevo · inbound lead recovery via `bbf-lead-concierge`) and System 2 (Resend · outbound athlete cold-pitch via `vision-scout/marketing/*`). Multiple AI agents have edited this codebase — Akeem coordinates them but warns context loss across sessions is real. Always confirm state from code/database, never from memory.

## Conventions (follow these)

### Branching
- Production: `main`
- Feature branch this session: `claude/gallant-pascal-11d8p`
- Workflow: commit feature → push → checkout main → pull → `git merge --ff-only <feature>` → push main → back to feature

### Commit messages
- Format: `type(scope): one-line summary` then blank line then detailed body
- Types observed: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `harden`, `diag`
- Scopes observed: `nutrition`, `marketing`, `marketing/dispatcher`, `marketing/triage`, `vision-scout`, `marketing/analyst`
- Body uses bullet points · explains WHY, not just WHAT
- Do NOT include AI-generated attribution strings, Claude/Gemini model IDs, or "🤖 Generated by..." footers in commit messages
- Do NOT include co-authored-by lines unless explicitly requested

### Deploys
- Push to `main` → Render auto-deploys vision-scout (~2-3 min including Docker rebuild)
- Push to `main` → GitHub Pages serves bbf-app.html / sw.js / other static files
- Supabase edge functions: deployed via MCP `deploy_edge_function` OR Supabase CLI · NOT auto-deployed from git
- Supabase migrations: applied via MCP `apply_migration` OR Supabase CLI · NOT auto-applied
- `render.yaml` values DO NOT auto-overwrite already-set Render env vars · manual env edits in Render dashboard required for changes

### Code style
- ESM in vision-scout (package.json `"type": "module"`)
- TypeScript in Supabase edge functions
- 2-space indent (mostly)
- Verbose top-of-file docstring explaining what the module does, why decisions were made, what the failure modes are
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
- No new dependencies without justification

### Service worker
- `sw.js:18` `var CACHE = 'bbf-vXXX'` MUST be bumped on every bbf-app.html / styles / JS change
- Auto-bumping is in Master Plan Phase 4.1

## Tools available to AI agents

If you have access to the same MCP setup as the previous Claude session:

- **Supabase MCP** (`mcp__3ff67aec-*`): full project access · `list_tables`, `execute_sql`, `apply_migration`, `deploy_edge_function`, `get_edge_function`, `get_logs`, `get_publishable_keys`, etc. Use this freely for queries; be careful with `apply_migration` and `deploy_edge_function` (production writes).
- **GitHub MCP** (`mcp__github_*`): scoped to `buildbelievefitllc/buildbelievefit`. Available when MCP server is connected (sometimes disconnects mid-session).
- **Bash tool**: shell access, but outbound HTTP to render.com / supabase.co URLs is BLOCKED by the sandbox. Use `net.http_post` via Supabase MCP `execute_sql` to invoke endpoints from Postgres instead.
- **Web fetch / search**: limited, use only when necessary.

Loading tools: many MCP tools are "deferred" — schema is hidden until you call `ToolSearch` with `select:<name>`. The first call costs nothing; load tools as you need them.

---

## Known gotchas (these have bitten us)

1. **`bbf-lead-concierge` and `bbf-user-profile`** are deployed Supabase edge functions that **do NOT exist in `supabase/functions/`**. If you need to read or modify them, pull source via `mcp__supabase__get_edge_function`. Master Plan 0.3 imports them properly.

2. **Service worker cache version (`sw.js:18`)** must be bumped manually on every bbf-app.html change. Forgetting this caused the Nutrition Wheel bug to persist across multiple deploys. Master Plan 4.1 + 5.3 automate this.

3. **`render.yaml` does not overwrite existing env vars in Render.** New values in render.yaml require manual env edits in Render's UI for changes to take effect. New keys DO get added on Blueprint re-apply (sometimes).

4. **Supabase service role key is set per-process at boot.** If you add an env var to Render and the process is already running, the marketing module's `db.js` will report `sb_client_built:false`. Lazy re-init covers this (commit cd4cac4), but a restart is still cleaner.

5. **Gemini 3.x has implicit thinking tokens** that count against `maxOutputTokens`. Disable with `thinkingConfig:{thinkingBudget:0}` (done in vision-scout/marketing/gemini.js).

6. **supabase-js@2.45+ on Node 20** requires the `ws` package passed as `realtime.transport`. Without it, `createClient` throws at construction time. Fixed in vision-scout/marketing/db.js · commit c9a7910.

7. **Playwright `--single-process` flag is fragile.** Currently in vision-scout/server.js per CEO directive. May cause blank screenshots; if Vision Scout starts misbehaving, this flag is the first suspect.

8. **The `BBF_MARKETING_ADMIN_TOKEN` was leaked** — the original value was pasted in a Claude session transcript on 2026-05-24. As of commit `6db5afb` (2026-05-25), the auth middleware uses SHA-256 + `crypto.timingSafeEqual` so a leaked-prefix attack is moot — but the full rotation (paste new value into Render dashboard) is still required to fully close Master Plan 0.1. The new token is held in chat; mark 0.1 `[x]` only after the Render env var is updated AND the old token returns 401.

9. **The CEO test override email is hardcoded** in `vision-scout/marketing/agents/dispatcher.js`. `bbf_test_lead@bbf-marketing-sentinel.dev` routes to `akeemkbrown@gmail.com`. Production lead emails are untouched, but this hardcode should be env-driven eventually.

10. **`bbf-app.html` has multiple inline event handlers** (`onclick="..."`) that reference global functions. When refactoring (Master Plan Phase 4), do not silently remove globals without verifying every onclick.

11. **Outbound HTTP from this sandbox to `vision-scout.onrender.com` is BLOCKED.** Use `net.http_get` / `net.http_post` from Supabase SQL via the MCP `execute_sql` tool. Pattern: fire `select net.http_get(url := '...', timeout_milliseconds := 15000) as request_id`, wait ~5-10s, then `select status_code, content::text from net._http_response where id = <request_id>`. For POSTs with auth, pass `headers := '{"Authorization":"Bearer ..."}'::jsonb`. `pg_net` is at version 0.20.0; `pg_cron` 1.6.4.

12. **Telemetry can be disabled per-process via `BBF_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true`.** Use this for local/dev runs that should not write to `bbf_agent_runs` / `bbf_llm_calls`. Default (env unset or anything other than `"true"`) is ENABLED. Telemetry writes are always try/catch-wrapped — a Supabase outage degrades gracefully (warns to console, swallows the error) so the outbound mail path stays healthy.

13. **Phase 0.2 telemetry is Node-side only right now.** The marketing engine in `vision-scout/marketing/` writes to `bbf_agent_runs` / `bbf_llm_calls`. The 25 Supabase edge functions do NOT yet. When adopting telemetry in a Deno-side function, port `vision-scout/marketing/telemetry.js` to a `supabase/functions/_shared/telemetry.ts` with the same `logRun()` / `logLlmCall()` shape so the rollup query keeps working.

14. **Agent naming convention for `bbf_agent_runs.agent`:** `marketing.<module>` (`marketing.scout`, `marketing.scout-engine`, `marketing.analyst`, `marketing.dispatcher`, `marketing.triage`, `marketing.unsubscribe`, `marketing.orchestrator`). For edge functions when they adopt telemetry, use `<area>.<function-name>` (e.g. `concierge.bbf-lead-concierge`). This keeps the dashboard groupings stable.

## How Akeem operates (observed in this session)

- **Directives are commands, not requests.** "Execute." "Deploy." "Push to main." Treat them as authorized actions, not exploration.
- **Wants honest takes, not yes-manning.** Said explicitly: "be real, don't be nice". Push back when you disagree.
- **Will redirect course quickly.** If he says "stop, pivot to X", drop current work and pivot. Don't argue.
- **Cares about engineering quality, not just shipping.** Will accept "this could break" if you flag the risk explicitly.
- **Acknowledges his own typos.** Multiple times this session he's corrected an email address or detail he originally provided. Treat his corrections as authoritative; don't reference the typo afterward.
- **Voice transcription artifacts.** Some messages come from voice (mentions "Breville Breville" for Brevo, "demark" for DMARC, etc.). Parse intent, not literal words.
- **No emojis unless he uses them first.** Match his register.

## What NOT to do

- **Do not push to main without going through the FF-merge flow.** Akeem authorized this workflow once; he expects continuity.
- **Do not edit applied migrations.** Add new migrations only.
- **Do not invent file paths, env var names, or model IDs.** Verify by grep/read.
- **Do not fabricate Claude's, Gemini's, or Resend's behavior.** If unsure, test or ask.
- **Do not silently delete code.** If removing, explain why in the commit body.
- **Do not skip pre-flight checks** (syntax check, smoke-test, /health probe) before declaring something done.
- **Do not lecture.** Match Akeem's terseness when he's direct.
- **Do not narrate sandbox limitations on every message.** Mention them once when relevant.

---

## First 10 minutes of your session

1. **Read this file completely.** (You're doing it.)
2. **Read `api/BBF_MASTER_PLAN.md`.**
3. **Run `git log --oneline -10`** to see recent commits.
4. **Check the deploy state**: `curl https://vision-scout.onrender.com/api/v1/marketing/health` returns the live env+client state. (You may need to fire this via `net.http_post` in Supabase if your sandbox blocks outbound.)
5. **Ask Akeem what he wants to attack**, or — if he said "start at Phase X step Y" — start there.

---

## Active credentials / accounts (location, not value)

- **Anthropic API key**: Supabase env var `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (used by ~17 edge functions)
- **Gemini API key**: Supabase env var `GEMINI_API_KEY` + Render env (vision-scout) same name
- **Resend API key**: Render env (vision-scout) `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **Brevo API key**: Supabase env var `BREVO_API_KEY` (used by `bbf-lead-concierge`)
- **Supabase service role key**: project secret · auto-injected to edge functions · Render env `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Supabase anon key**: in `bbf-app.html` as `window.ENV_SUPABASE_KEY` (client-side, OK)
- **Stripe webhook secret**: edge function env
- **Vapi credentials**: edge function env

Akeem owns all accounts. He'll provide values when you need them. **Never log secret values to console or commit them to repo.**
